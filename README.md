# bmi
This program calculates the body mass index, or bmi, based on weight and weight

# Build & run
- the make file uses the as and ld commands to build the program
- on Unix/Linux X86_64 systems you can build the program by running the command:
```sh
make
```

## 100% assembly
All of these programs are intentionally made with plain CPU instructions.
it does not use the C standard library or libraries from any other language.

### Who is this for?
for most programming languages today, there are plenty of small programs and open code bases that everyone can use to learn. But not for assembly language. As if the language wasn't challenging enough there are hardly any complete, non-trivial, programs to be found anywhere. and most of what I've seen rely on higher-level languages for convenience.

These programs are my naive and futile attempt to help with that.

hopefully, someone would find this useful or interesting.
